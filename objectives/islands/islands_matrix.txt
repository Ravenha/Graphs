Write a function that takes a 2D binary array and returns the number of 1 islands.
An island consists of 1s that are connected to the north, south, east or west. For example:
islands = [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
           [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
islands[0][1]
islands[1][1]
1. Describe in graphs terminology
- What are our nodes? 1s
- When do we have an edge to another node? if one step away, to NSEW
What do we call a group of 1s/nodes? Connected components
2. Build your graph or define getNeighbors()
3. Choose your algorithm
